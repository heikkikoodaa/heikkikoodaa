### Hello friend! ðŸ˜¸

No need for formalities, my name's Heikki and I'm a self-taught web developer. I'm still honing my craft by building cool projects and trying out different online courses. Lately, I've been geeking out on ReactJS, Redux, GraphQL, Google Firebase, and Node.js because they're super trendy and work like a charm for all sorts of projects.

### How to reach me

### Fun fact:

You know what's my jam? Chomping down on some rye bread slathered with mustard, all while laughing my guts out to the wackiest YouTube videos out there ðŸ”¥
