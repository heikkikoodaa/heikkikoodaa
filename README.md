### Hello friend! ðŸ˜¸

My name is Heikki and I'm a self-taught web developer. I'm currently working on developing my skills even further by building my projects as well as attending a variety of different online courses. My focus is currently on ReactJS, Redux, GraphQL, Google Firebase, and Node.js due to their popularity and suitability for different projects.

### How to reach me

If you're looking for a developer to join your team, you can best reach out to me on LinkedIn or by simply sending me an email.

### Fun fact:

I love eating mustard on rye bread while watching random YouTube videos ðŸ”¥
