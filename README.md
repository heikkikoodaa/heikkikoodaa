# Hello there! ðŸ˜¸

Iâ€™m Heikki â€” a web developer with nearly 3 years of professional experience building modern, scalable applications.  
What started as a self-taught hobby has grown into a full-time craft, and Iâ€™ve had the chance to work with everything from **React & Redux** on the frontend to **Node.js & cloud services** on the backend.

I enjoy tackling with problems and pain points, and Iâ€™m always curious about new tools that can make life easier (or at least less bug-filled).

## âš¡ Fun fact
Give me a slice of rye bread with mustard and a good playlist of absurd YouTube videos, and Iâ€™m set for the evening.  
(Yes, itâ€™s an acquired taste.)
